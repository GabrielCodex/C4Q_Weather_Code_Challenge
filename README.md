# C4Q_Weather_Code_Challenge

 I would improve how I created by custom CollectionViewCell. I didn't spend a whole bunch of time on making it look pretty.

 The dateTimeISO can be nil or not exist. That caught me off guard. Should have spent more time looking at the data. Lesson learned and I made DateISO optional. I was running low on time so I would have like to handle nil in the model instead of handling it in the CollectionView Cell.

Made a Enum to hangle Weather Errors but didn't get a chance to use it.
